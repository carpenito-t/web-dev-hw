           <h2>Inner Box</h2>
           <p>this is an inner box. i going to try and type as much as i can here so that the box will overflow and it will have to be scrolled to see whats in the text box. This way in will not spill into the other box or will not be cut off by the other box, I think for this its the best looking way to set it up.</p>
